## What is TUF?


The Update Framework (TUF) maintains the security of software update systems, providing protection even against attackers that compromise the repository or signing keys. TUF provides a flexible framework and [specification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/) that developers can adopt into any software update system.
