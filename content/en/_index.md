## What is TUF?


The Update Framework (TUF) helps developers maintain the security of software update systems, providing protection even against attackers that compromise the repository or signing keys. TUF provides a flexible framework and [specification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/) that developers can adopt into any software update system.

TUF is hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as part of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io) (CNCF) and is [used in production](/adoptions) by various tech companies and open source organizations. A variant of TUF called [Uptane](https://uptane.github.io/) is widely used to secure over-the-air updates in automobiles.
